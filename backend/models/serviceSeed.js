        serviceDescription: "A hydro facial is a non-invasive cosmetic procedure that involves the use of a specialized machine to cleanse, exfoliate, and hydrate the skin. The treatment typically involves several steps, including cleansing the skin, applying a gentle acid peel, extracting impurities and blackheads, and infusing the skin with a serum containing antioxidants, peptides, and hyaluronic acid to moisturize and plump the skin. Hydro facials are suitable for all skin types and can help improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and acne-prone skin.",

        serviceDescription: "Microdermabrasion is a minimally invasive cosmetic procedure that involves using a specialized device to exfoliate the top layer of dead skin cells on the face. The device uses tiny crystals or a diamond tip to remove the outermost layer of skin, revealing smoother, more even-toned skin underneath. The procedure is typically painless and can be done in a dermatologist's office or at a medical spa. Microdermabrasion can help improve the appearance of fine lines, sun damage, acne scars, and uneven skin texture. It is safe for all skin types and requires no downtime.",

        serviceName: "Chemical Peel",
        servicePrice: "$50",
        serviceDescription: "A chemical peel is a cosmetic procedure that involves applying a chemical solution to the skin to remove the outermost layer of dead skin cells and promote the growth of new, smoother skin. The solution typically contains a combination of acids, such as alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs), or trichloroacetic acid (TCA), and may be tailored to the individual's skin type and concerns. The depth of the peel can range from superficial to deep, depending on the concentration of the solution and the desired outcome. Chemical peels can help improve the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, sun damage, acne scars, and hyperpigmentation. They can be done in a dermatologist's office or at a medical spa and require some downtime depending on the depth of the peel.",
