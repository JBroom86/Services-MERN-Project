## Unsolved Mysteries &#128125;

<p>This project really tested my knowledge of React and connecting the frontend and the backend.  The sign-up logic still isn't functioning 100% so I have removed it for the time being.  </p>

## Next Steps &#127776;

<p>I would like to continue to develop this application so that it can be truly useful for my niece.  Future additions will include a calendar scheduler, signup capabilities that function, building out a full products page, and adding a certifications section. </p>
